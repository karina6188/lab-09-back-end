## Overview
This application is called City Explorer, which allows users to come to the website and type in a location in anywhere without knowing the location's latitude and longitude. Then the website will return the current weather information of that location. If the location the user input is not found or if anything goes wrong on the website, the user will be notified the situation.  

## Getting Started
When users want to build this app on their own machine, they first go to our GitHub page and git clone the app to their local repo. Then in their local repo, create a file called .env and inside .env file, put the exact wording that is inside the single quotes 'PORT=3000' into the file. Then in their terminal, run npm -init -y, npm i -S express cors dotenv. This will install all the dependencies with the same versions we use on our app that are also listed in the package.json file to their local machine so they can run our app.

## Architecture
In this app, we used JavaScript, Express, cors, and dotenv. Express is the library that lets us set up a server. Cors initializes our express server. It tells the browser it is ok to communicate with the domain that the js isn't running on and tells the browser that you want the client domain to be able to make server requests. Dotenv is the library that lets us talk to our .env file. 

## Change Log

09-17-2019 11:25am - App is now successfully running on the express server and is deployed through Heroku. The app has the first feature 'Location', which has a route of /location and shows the location's search query, formatted address, latitude, and longitude.

09-17-2019 12:40am - The second feature 'Weather' of the app is now available and is deployed on Heroku. This feature allows the users to know the upcoming 8 days of weather conditions of the location they input.
